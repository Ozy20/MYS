# 1. Use the same Node version as backend for consistency
FROM node:22-alpine

# 2. Set the working directory
# Just like the backend, this creates '/app' and enters it
WORKDIR /app

# 3. Copy package files first
COPY frontend/my-app/package*.json ./

# 4. Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# 5. Copy the rest of the application code
COPY frontend/my-app/ .

# 6. Expose Vite's default port
# This tells Docker we intend to use port 5173
EXPOSE 5173

# 7. Start the Vite server
# IMPORTANT: We add '-- --host' to expose the app to the network
